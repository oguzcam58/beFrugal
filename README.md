SWE599 - Software Project.

This is my first Android Project.
I have watched Udacity->Developing Android Apps tutorial before starting to write this application. Then, as a developer I searched for many things find them on the internet and use them on my way.

This is basically a list-sublist application but it will have some features like calculating your basket price and inform you before you pay. What's more, it will have a feature to select the place you are in, where you buy that stuff. Also, when you want to buy same stuff, you may check, where you bought that before and how much you paid for it.

It will make you remember, how much you should pay and plan your budget according to your experiences.

It is a standalone project, no dependencies except Google's place API for defining the store you are in. So, because everyday, the price you paid tend to change, database of this application keeps just the latest one month data.
